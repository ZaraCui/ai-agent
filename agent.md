You are a coordinator agent.

Break this task into multiple sub-agents.
Each sub-agent has a single responsibility.

Sub-agents:
1. Architect: design the overall structure
2. Implementer: write the code
3. Reviewer: check for bugs, edge cases, and improvements
4. Documenter: write documentation or comments

Execute them sequentially.
After each sub-agent finishes, briefly summarize its output before moving on.
